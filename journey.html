            <h2>Odysseus's Battles</h2>
            <p>When Poseidon spots Odyseus and his men sailing at sea, the sea god shipwrecks their ship on a nearby island. Later when sailing at sea once again, Odysseus and his men encounter a severe storm brought on by Athena, which blows them off course into the land of the Lotus Eaters. After escaping the land of the Lotus Eaters, Odysseus and his man explore the land of the cyclops where Polyphemus, a ruthless one-eyed giant, traps and eats many of Odysseus’ men before he manages to escape by blinding the one-eyed monster. Later when escaping yet another island, the cannibalistic Laestrygonians sink all their ships except for Odysseus'. The surviving crew members reach Aeaea, where the beutiful enchantress Circe turns many of them into pigs. After surviving the temptations of the sea Sirens and a attack by Scylla, a six-headed monster, Zeus kills all of the crew member except for Odysseus as they leave the island of the Sungod Helios. Odysseus then stays captive on Calypso’s island for 7 years before being released and returning home.  </p>
